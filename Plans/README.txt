HOLLOW 3D RENDERER
===================================


TO-DO:
~~~ DO THEM IN THIS ORDER
- MAKE WINDOW SIZABLE / TOGGLE FULLSCREEN (FIRST ATTEMPT = FAILED, WINDOW IS BROKEN NOW)
- ADD DIFFERENT GEOMETRICAL OBJECTS (PYRAMIDS, SPHERES) AND RENDER ALL OF THEM AS IF THEY ARE DIFFERENT MODELS
- MAKE THE GEOMETRICAL SHAPES LOAD AS IF THEY ARE MODELS (MEANING WRITE THE VERTEX, NORMAL, TEXTURE DATA INSIDE A TXT FILE AND READ IT FROM THERE)
- ADD TEXTURES TO THE CUBE AND MAKE THEM INTERACT WITH THE LIGHT SOURCE


LATER:
- TRANSFORMATION CLASS (PROBABLY A MATH CLASS THAT INCLUDES TRANSFORMATIONS TOO WILL BE NEEDED)

CURRENT BUGS
- WHEN DRAWING THE TEST CUBE, THE LIGHT WORKS FINE EXCEPT FOR THE FARTEST VERTEX (WHICH GETS LIGHT). REPAIR THE LIGHT CALCULATIONS (NOT SURE)

!!!!! IT'S GETTING SCARIER NOW !!!!!
- MODEL LOADING (MODEL, MESH)
- MULTIPLE MODELS
- SKYBOX
- ADVANCED LIGHTING (CONSIDERING BASIC LIGHTING WORKS)
- MOVE THE OBJECTS USING KEYBOARD OR BY CLICK AND DRAG
- ADD GIZMO SO OBJECTS IN THE SCENE CAN BE SELECTED, TRANSLATED, ROTATED, SCALED

THATS ALL FOR NOW
